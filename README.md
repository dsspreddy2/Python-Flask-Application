# Python-Flask-Application

1. app.py - Python Flask Application
Description: This is the main application file for your web application. It uses Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python. The application defines a single route (/) that returns a simple greeting message.
Usage: Run this Python script to start your Flask web application.
2. requirements.txt - Python Dependencies File
Description: This file lists the necessary Python packages required for your application, ensuring consistent environments across different setups. Currently, it only includes flask, which is the web framework used.
Usage: Use this file to install dependencies via pip (e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt).
3. Dockerfile - Docker Configuration for Python Application
Description: This Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image for your Flask application. It includes instructions for setting the Python environment, copying your application files, installing dependencies, and specifying how to run the application.
Usage: Build a Docker image from this file and run it as a container.
4. nginx.conf - NGINX Configuration File
Description: This configuration file sets up NGINX as a reverse proxy, which forwards requests to your Flask application running in a Docker container. It ensures that NGINX listens on port 80 and routes incoming traffic to your application.
Usage: Place this file in the appropriate directory for NGINX to read and use it to configure the NGINX server.
5. docker-compose.yml - Docker Compose File
Description: This file is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It orchestrates the setup by defining services, such as your Flask app and NGINX, including their configurations, dependencies, and the relationships between them.
Usage: Use this file with Docker Compose to easily build and start both the application and NGINX containers with a single command.
